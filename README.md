## Introduction

**`Hisnul Muslim iOS App`** is a digital version of the popular book of supplications and prayers for Muslims. It provides easy access to a collection of authentic prayers and supplications that are derived from the Quran and Sunnah, which are the teachings and practices of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him).

The app features a user-friendly interface with supplications organized thematically, covering topics such as morning and evening supplications, prayers for specific occasions, and supplications for protection and seeking guidance.

The "ÿ≠ŸêÿµŸÜ ÿßŸÑŸÖÿ≥ŸÑŸÖŸê" app is designed to be a convenient tool for Muslims to have access to a collection of authentic supplications at their fingertips, whether at home, work, or on-the-go.

        }
        
        return Just(fileURL)
            .tryMap { try Data(contentsOf: $0) }
            .mapError { _ in HSErrors.unableToReadFile }
            .eraseToAnyPublisher()
    }
    
    func decodable<T: Decodable>(type Model: T.Type, _ fileName: String) -> AnyPublisher<T, HSErrors> {
        readFile(fileName)
            .decode(type: T.self, decoder: JSONDecoder())
